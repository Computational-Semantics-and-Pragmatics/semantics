1. The notions _denotation_ and _reference_ seem prone to confusion. Explain the

1. Take the following sentences:

    1. `Jane didn't see the only Armani dress at the party.`
    1. `Jane didn't wear the only Armani dress at the party.`

    These two sentences differ not only in their main verbs, they also differ in
    other entailments. What are they? Are they implicatures or presuppositions
    or what? Why do these sentences differ in this respect, do you think? The
    difference must be somewhat related to `see` versus `wear`, but what is it?
